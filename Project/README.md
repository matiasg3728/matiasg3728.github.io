So this is not finished.  The most core element of the game, the Grid, I could not get it to work as i wanted it to.
I had big plans for this game but at first I was adamant about not using a grid to play this game but I realized to late that
needed one and I just hadnt worked out all the kinks yet.

There is alot of code in this repository.  Within the Project/ folder you can find the newest attempt at my game and the 
broken code in it.  There is another file in that folder however with a quick number sequence solver game.  That is what im
turning in today.

The ideas are good, they just need more work.  They need to work together more.  Maybe I will try making point classes to 
represent occupied grid spaces instead of using arrays, which are a bit cluncky to use by themselves.  The main problem with
the grid is moving elements around it.  There might be a better way than a 2d array.
